                     The Language Processing Lab is based in <a href="http://ling.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages</a> and <a href="http://bmi.cuhk.edu.hk/" target="_blank">Brain and Mind Institute</a>, The Chinese University of Hong Kong. 
					 We are interested in language comprehension, production and learning. The lab has the following foci in research,among others. 
                  </p>				  
				  <ol>
		<li>How people take their interlocutor into account in comprehending and producing language</li>
		<li>Chinese handwriting literacy: deep-learning-based diagnosis and neurocognitive mechanisms </li>
		
							  
				  </ol>
 <h4>JOINING THE LAB</h4>
				  <ol>
<li><b>Positions available </b>The lab is looking for a postdoc or research assistant with good experience in fMRI, Bayesian modelling, or machine learning. If you have such skills, please send your CV to zhenguangcai(at)cuhk.edu.hk.</li>
<li><b>PhD application </b>The lab has been successful in obtaining three <a href="https://cerg1.ugc.edu.hk/hkpfs/index.html" target="_blank">Hong Kong PhD Fellowships</a> and a couple of CUHK scholarships, apart from some departmental studentships. If you want to do a PhD at the lab (and in the Department of Linguistics and Modern Languages), please send us an email. We are only interested in applicants with a strong empirical/computational background.</li>
